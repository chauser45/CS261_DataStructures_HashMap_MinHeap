This repo consists of the assignment prompt as well as my submission in the class CS261: Data Structure. 

The assignment prompt details the requirements as well as the questions I answered in the written pdf "HauserCH Canvas Submission."

The .py files min_heap and hash_map contain some skeleton code but are mostly my own work and showcase an understanding of these two data structures along
with their relevant helper functions and terminology.

the a5_include.py file contains helper functions which were provided to students.
